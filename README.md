If you need to change how things work, or make things more customizable you can take inspiration from:

- [`kcd-scripts`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kcd-scripts) - Kent C. Dodds variant of this idea.
- [`tsdx`](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/tsdx) - A zero config toolchain for TypeScript libraries.
- [`react-scripts`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/react-scripts) - Create React App scripts, maybe not that useful, since these are for app development, not libraries.
